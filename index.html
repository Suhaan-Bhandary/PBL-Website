                <p>Do you ever feel lost in this cluster of assignments and links of Lectures on different platform ?
                </p>
                <p>And do you ever miss important information and due dates of assignments ?</p>
                <p>Thus to solve this issue, we came up with a simple way to keep all information one touch away.</p>
                <p>We are Intoducing LookUp,a simple and interactive website which will allow to share all assignments
                    and important instructions from teachers to the students on any device.</p>

            <h2>Part 1 : Founded the problem</h2>
            <p>
                We found this problem among students that they we confused because of the bunch of links in their social media
                platform
                and the links we distributed among many groups and some links were sents only once and this was used for the
                semester.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other problem was that many students were having hard time keeping the due dates of daily and weekly assignments.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>We talked with teachers and students and took their oppinions,it took us some time and then we started gathering different solutions.</p>
            <p>Out of the solutions we picked the best in terms of ease of using and time taken to implement it.</p>
            <p>We gathered informations required to develop it.</p>

            <h2>Fetch v/s Axios</h2>
            <p>
                During the teacher login and student login process,we had to make a decision of fetching data from 
                our django rest api and for fetching the data we had to use one of the tools to conect the database
                with our application seemlessly.
            </p>
            <p>We were clear that we had to use a promise based request for this work as it is fast and also supports json
                format which is mostly used in real world projects.
            </p>
            <p>In react we directly use fetch function which is a preinstalled library that come with js and supports
                most modern browsers,we used fetch to connect to the client and made the login page.
            </p>
            <p>But something seem wrong with this approach and our code base was flooding with fetch requests.
                After some research we found that axios is a good alternative for fetching data and it works similar to
                the fetch but has a clear structure to work with,so we decided to go with Axios.
            </p>
            <p>Below are some key points about axios and fetch ,so that one can compare both of them : </p>

            <h2>A small break !</h2>
            <p>
                Now will be wondering why a break in this wonderful journey, and the answer is the in-sem Exam
                and yes one can ask why we cannot do the work in free time of in small chunk of time ?
            </p>
            <p>And the simple and straightforward answer is managing the meeting time is hard as its been conducted
                online and as every member in our group has his own sweet time and syncing times between the members is 
                already hard for anyone and even more harder because of the current situation when we handle the meeting virtually.
            </p>
            <p>With that said,In 21 June 2021 to 27 June 2021  : less updates or no updates on the project will be made.</p>
            <p>And regular meeting schedule will start from 27/28 June 2021 </p>

            <h2>The end or the beginning of a new journey</h2>
            <p>
                Journey ends with this last paragraph as we have given a deadline to submit the project,so we have to rush it up and build it with few features.</p>

            <p>
                I was shocked to hear about it but it looks like, life test us in very unknown circumstances.
            </p>

            <p>So we packed the project and gave our best and made it in 1 week, its not the best but its best relative to the time provided.</p>
            
            <p>But I will try to make a clone of it and add all the features I needed in it !</p>
            <h3>At last, one can do anything !</h3>
