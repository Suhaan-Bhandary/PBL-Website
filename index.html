                </p>
                <p>And do you ever miss important information and due dates of assignments ?</p>
                <p>Thus to solve this issue, we came up with a simple way to keep all information one touch away.</p>

                    and important instructions from teachers to the students on any device.</p>

                <p>React is the most popular front-end JavaScript library in the field of web development. It is used by large, established
                companies and newly-minted startups alike (Netflix, Airbnb, Instagram, and the New York Times, to name a few). React
                brings many advantages to the table, making it a better choice than other frameworks like Angular.js.</p>

                <p>Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by
                experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app
                without needing to reinvent the wheel. It is free and open source, has a thriving and active community, great
                documentation, and many options for free and paid-for support.</p>

                management systems, SQLite is not a clientâ€“server database engine. Rather, it is embedded into the end program.</p>

            <h2>Part 1 : Founded the problem</h2>
            <p>
                We found this problem among students that they we confused because of the bunch of links in their social media
                platform
                and the links we distributed among many groups and some links were sents only once and this was used for the
                semester.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other problem was that many students were having hard time keeping the due dates of daily and weekly assignments.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>We talked with teachers and students and took their oppinions,it took us some time and then we started gathering different solutions.</p>
            <p>Out of the solutions we picked the best in terms of ease of using and time taken to implement it.</p>
            <p>We gathered informations required to develop it.</p>
